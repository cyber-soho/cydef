## Cyber Defense Course

This repository contains all course materials, labs, and resources for the Cyber Defense (420-2C1-DW) course, part of the Cybersecurity: Prevention and Intervention (LEA.D8) AEC Program.

### Course Description :

Building on the foundational knowledge acquired in Preventative Monitoring, this course delves into advanced techniques for hardening hosts and securing networks and data. Students will learn to utilize appropriate tools, implement robust access control measures, and apply cryptographic techniques to safeguard information systems. This course is designed to equip students with the skills necessary to protect against cyber threats and prepares them for the subsequent course in the series, Incident Management.

### Learning Outcomes :

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Secure a network through perimeter defense and network segmentation.

- Control access to hosts and harden them using a variety of hardening techniques.

- Apply the relevant cryptographic techniques to secure systems, as well as stored and transitory data.

### Core Competency :

This course is built to satisfy the competency:

EZ03: Application of access control measures.

### Key Topics & Technologies :

This course provides hands-on experience with a wide range of open-source security tools. The weekly schedule covers:

- Network Firewalls:

  - iptables

  - UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

  - OPNsense: Installation, configuration, VLANs, and firewall rules.

  - IPFire: Zone-based firewall configuration (Red, Green, Blue, Orange).

- Host Hardening:

  - Secure SSH configurations

  - Linux file permissions and Access Control Lists (ACLs)

  - Fail2Ban for automated brute-force protection.

- Intrusion Detection & Monitoring (IDS/SIEM):

  - Security Onion: Architecture and deployment.

  - Suricata: Network Intrusion Detection (NIDS).

  - Wazuh: Host-based Intrusion Detection (HIDS) and SIEM.

- Deception & Threat Intelligence:

  - OpenCanary: Low-interaction honeypot.

  - Cowrie: Medium-interaction SSH/Telnet honeypot.

### ⚠️ Cybersecurity Lab Warning :

The skills and techniques discussed in this course are for educational and authorized purposes ONLY.

All hands-on practice must be conducted in a secure, isolated lab environment (e.g., virtual machines) completely disconnected from any public or private networks. Applying these skills to any system, network, or application without explicit, written permission from the owner is illegal and may result in severe civil and criminal penalties.

Practice legally and ethically.
